Description: 
    Provides tools for performing Box-Cox transformations, inverse Box-Cox transformations, 
    and estimating the optimal lambda for such transformations. Additionally, the package 
    includes functionality to generate normalized and diagnostic plots, output diagnostic 
    summaries, and analyze non-normal numeric data. It is designed to help stabilize variance 
    and make data more normally distributed for statistical modeling and analysis.
