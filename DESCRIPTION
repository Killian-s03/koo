Description: 
       Provides tools for performing Box-Cox transformations, inverse Box-Cox transformations, 
    and estimating the optimal lambda for these transformations. The package also includes 
    functionality to generate normalized and diagnostic plots, output diagnostic summaries, 
    and analyze non-normal numeric data. These tools are designed to stabilize variance, 
    improve data normality, and facilitate statistical modeling and analysis.
